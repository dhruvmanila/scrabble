"""
There are JSON files in the words_json folder containing words of different
length which I got from the internet. This script is used to parse all the
files into a list and converting that into a python dictionary where the
keys are the length of words and the values are all the words in a list of
same length. This dictionary is stored in words.json file for later use.

Sample:
[
    {
        "word":"aa"
        },
    {
        "word":"ab"
        }
]
